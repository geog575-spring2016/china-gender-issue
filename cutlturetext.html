	China's gender imbalance largely effected today's chinese culture and economy, but has also been largely influeced by past policies such as the One Child Policy, and high cultural pressures that value having a single child and having a son over a daughter.

	The map <!-- position above.bellow--> shows a significant trend when looking at both urban and rural newborn in 2000 and 2010, suggesting that the gender imbalance steaming from teh One Child Policy is still becoming an issue. Darker colored provences demonstrate a higher sex-ratio, where an normal sex-ratio at birth is expexted to naturally be around 105:100 males to females. There is also a somewhat high correlation between areas with a high infant sex-ratio and a low marriage rate.

	There are two main cultural ideals that have become particularly apparent since the implemetnation of the One Child Policy- despite any implementation of policy, Chinese society values families with one child and sees men as more valuable than women even at birth. 

	Lionel Jensen, a professor of East Asian Languages and Culture at Notre Dame, told <a href="sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/china-on-child-policy-fuxian-yi/?_r=0">New York Times</a> "China has succeeded in created a single-child culture," pointing out that many couples nowadays are often likely to abort their second child or simply not tell their parents another child is on the way. Jensen says the value of having one child "is patriotic, definitively Chinese, and economically rational," even there is clear economic drawbacks.

	And along with the continuation of the one child culture, the cultural pull to have a baby boy still exists. Even before the one child policy, the Chinese culture was largely male-doinated society <a href "">(Sudbeck,43)</a>.

	In Rural areas, work is limited to a predominately male industires, causing women to have to leave to work in city factories, leading to decreased marriage rates in these areas. 

	Additionally, no matter the gender of the child, that child is going to be expected to support three or possibly more people through out their lifes- the child themselves and the the child's two parents and possibly the child's family. The cultural and family pressures to support families come early in life along with the pressures to obtain good grades and find a stable job and success early. With the One Child Policy, parents manage their child's time from early on to set them up for such success. With the additional stress and structure placed upon the only child by their parents, it is not unsurprissing that a fall in birth-rates in general have occured. It is not the only child's first ambition to marry or even to have children anymore, as they may be more focused on supporting the family they have had since childhood. 

	The Gender Imbalances has been argued to both empower women() while negetively impacting the male-dominated stress of industrial work force(), and degreade women()

(this could go with map1... like map2 could go with the policy text...)///////////////////////////////////////////////////

	When economic pressures are high and families are located in rural areas, boys are considered more valuble at birth. They are seen to bring home more economic value and be able to support their parents later on. Women are less likely to do the types of work that is required in the ares, such as mining, mineral extraction, and other industiralious labor activities. Women may leave these areas entirely for permminatnt or seasonal work in cities. 
	Concequently, there are women competeing for jobs in nicer work conditions for men, and where many men are pressured into high-risk work conditions ().
