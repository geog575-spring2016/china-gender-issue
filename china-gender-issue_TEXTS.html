	China's gender imbalance largely affected today's chinese culture and economy, but has also been largely influeced by past policies such as the One Child Policy, and high cultural pressures that value having a single child and having a son over a daughter.  
</div>
<div id="map1text" class="text">	
	This map shows a significant trend when looking differences in rural and urban trends amoungst newborn sex-ratios and marriage rates from 2010, suggesting that the gender imbalance steaming from teh One Child Policy is still becoming an issue. Darker colored provences demonstrate a higher sex-ratio, where an normal sex-ratio at birth is expexted to naturally be around 105:100 males to females. There is also a somewhat high correlation between areas with a high infant sex-ratio and a low marriage rate. 
</div>
<div id="map2text" class="text">
	The map (above/POSITION) offers a peak into the sex-ratios for the overall population (infants, children, adults and elders) across the provences in 5 year increments before and during the One Chld Policy. The policy was implemented in 1979, and most heavily implemented until the mid-1990s. Despite a relaxation in the policy, there is still a tendency to have one child, and an additional pressure for that one child to be a boy. The decision to offiially remove the One Child Policy was announced in 2015.

	The One Child Policy was first implemented in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping, as an incentive for families to only bare one child when the Chinese population was rising quickly and Beijing needed a way to mitigate such a growth. <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/120114/understanding-chinas-one-child-policy.asp"> </a> The government encouraged late marriage, late child-bearing, and targeted rural areas in particular to decreass growth rates. Following the introduction of the One Child Policy in 1979, China exprienced infanticide, sterilization, and forced and volentary abortions alike. Chine faced foreign critic and judgment because of it. When faced with the the limitations of only bearing one child, Chinese families looked to the traditional econiomic and social benenfits of having a son.

	Although the policy itself is dependent on decisions in Beijing, it is Ultimately impletmented on a local-level to be able to tackle the unique and diverse regions throughout China. <a ref="http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/stable/172250?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=one&searchText=child&searchText=policy&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Done%2Bchild%2Bpolicy%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&seq=2#page_scan_tab_contents"></a> Into 1990s, concequences even involved confication of land and large fees ( <a href="http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/stable/3776687?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=one&searchText=child&searchText=policy&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Done%2Bchild%2Bpolicy%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">China Amends One-Child Policy, 2003</a>), but many exceptions were made at the local level in rural areas allowing for an additional child under certain circumstances, such as if the a child is disabled or born a female(<a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/publications/464">Short and Zhai, 1998</a>).</p>
	<p>
	The policy has been changed many times up until 2015, when plans were annoucned to discontinue the policy. In 2002, the policy was altered to allow for families with more than one child to be able "to pay a 'social comensation fee' instead of a fine." <a href= "http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/stable/3776687?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=one&searchText=child&searchText=policy&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Done%2Bchild%2Bpolicy%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"></a>  One reason for this change was to minimize the corruption involving local officials pocketing money for unplanned births in the past. Foreign critics didn't nessisarly praise this change, suggesting that "China redefines extra offspring as burden rather than offense." Despite foreign critic and a skewed birth rate, the birth rate lowered as expected, and so did child poverity rates. ()

<div id="culture" class="text">
	<a href=""></a>
	There are two main cultural ideals that have become particularly apparent since the implemetnation of the One Child Policy- despite any implementation of policy, Chinese society values families with one child and sees men as more valuable than women even at birth. 

	Lionel Jensen, a professor of East Asian Languages and Culture at Notre Dame, told <a href="http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/china-one-child-policy-fuxian-yi/?_r=0">New York Times</a> "China has succeeded in created a single-child culture," pointing out that many couples nowadays are often likely to abort their second child or simply not tell their parents another child is on the way. Jensen says the value of having one child "is patriotic, definitively Chinese, and economically rational," even there is clear economic drawbacks.

	And along with the continuation of the one child culture, the cultural pull to have a baby boy still exists. Even before the one child policy, the Chinese culture was largely male-doinated society <a href "">(Sudbeck,43)</a>.

	In Rural areas, work is limited to a predominately male industires, causing women to have to leave to work in city factories, leading to decreased marriage rates in these areas. 

	No matter the gender of the child, that child is going to be expected to support three or possibly more people through out their lifes- the child themselves and the the child's two parents and possibly the child's family. The cultural and family pressures to support families come early in life along with the pressures to obtain good grades and find a stable job and success early. With the One Child Policy, parents manage their child's time from early on to set them up for such success. With the additional stress and structure placed upon the only child by their parents, it is not unsurprissing that a fall in birth-rates amongst One Child Policy babies has become a trend-  they simply do not have time to start families, and concequently there is a lower marriage rate. Often times, men are seen as being more able to accomplish the expectations that their parent's set for the only child. And in many cases, women have no desire to get married and start families. <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/06/05/gender-imbalance-china-one-child-law-backfired-men-336435.html">The reason young urban women in China these days are putting off marriage—working longer than they might have in the past, and earning more—is because they can. "</a>  It is not the only child's first ambition to marry or even to have children anymore, as they may be more focused on supporting the family they have had since childhood, or on their own professional or personal goals instead.

	Other journalists and scholars have pointed out that the gender balance may have <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/06/05/gender-imbalance-china-one-child-law-backfired-men-336435.html"> indirectly empowered women,</a> while studies have also shown that the gender imbalance impacts men more ways than just finding a partner, as there is a strong correlation within areas with dangerous working conditions (<a ref="http://www.nber.org/papers/w16800.pdf">Wei and Zhang, 2011</a>) and a high gender imbalance, demonstrated via overall sex ratio.

<div id="economy" class="text">
	Within the past century, China's role in the global economy has grown rapidly, and many see that China still has much room in terms of it's ability to grow. The vast majority of China's economic centers are located in the eastern part of the country, with many located near the coast for easy access to ports. The eastern side of China long since been an economic pull for Chinese rural-urban migrants. The One Child Policy, in part, was directed at rural communities, allowing an additional child only if the family's first born was a girl. Following the One Child Policy, China also implemented a "Reform and Open Up" economic policy which made it desirable for rural youth to find more promissing work in the manufacturing urban areas in the East(<a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/chinas-young-rural-urban-migrants-search-fortune-happiness-and-independence">Migration Policy Institute</a>). 145 million past and recent rural-urban migrants were reported in 2009, which is aproximately 11% of China's total population. China faces numerous economic challenges wiht its rapid expansion, many of them have been linked to the One Child Policy. With an extremely low birth rate (<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html">12.49 births/1,000 , ranked 159th in the world (2015 est.) </a>), an unstable growth rate(<a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html">0.45% , ranked 162nd in the world(2015 est.) </a>), a highly involved gender imbalance, and a massive number rural youth leaving the country side, the fate of China's economic future does not come without critique or thorough debate. 


	When economic pressures are high and families are located in rural areas, boys are considered more valuble at birth. They are seen to have more economic potential and be able to support their parents later on. Women are less likely to do the types of work that is required in the ares, such as mining, mineral extraction, and other industiralious labor activities. Women may leave these areas entirely for permminatnt or seasonal work in cities. Concequently, "households with a son in regions with a more skewed sex ratio demonstrate a greater willingness to accept relatively dangerous or unpleasant jobs and supply more work days (<a ref="http://www.nber.org/papers/w16800.pdf">Wei and Zhang, 2011</a>)."

	Between the limitations brought on rural families by the One Child Policy and economic factors driving youth into urban areas, some pose the question of <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2013-08/22/content_29795567.htm">"Who is going to feed China?"</a> in relation to temptations for some to abandon the rural, agricultural workforce, and for others to be tempted to use land for something a bit more cost-effective than growing crops. Changes in early 2000s that allowed for more than one child with a compensation fee affect more urban families than rural. Additionally, "Rural families and ethnic minorities can legitimetely have more than one child, especially if the first is a girl<a href="http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.library.wisc.edu/stable/3776687?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=one&searchText=child&searchText=policy&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Done%2Bchild%2Bpolicy%26amp%3Bacc%3Don%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">China Amends One-Child Policy, 2003</a>)." Yet, exceptions like these in rural areas had been made on a local level in many places for years (<a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/publications/464">Short and Zhai, 1998</a>).
	
	In contrast, economic mobility has greatly improved in Urban areas since the One Child Policy (<a href="https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/anderson/POVMOBOCPriwA.pdf">Andersen and Leo, 2008</a>), but the One Child Policy alone probably is not the only government incentive that is responsible for this trend.
